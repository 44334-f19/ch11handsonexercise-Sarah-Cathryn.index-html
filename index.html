    <h1>Copyright</h1>
    <h3>The Origins, Uses and Laws of Today</h3>
    
<ol>
<li>The Origins</li> 
    
    <p>Copyright stems form the late fifteenth centry England when printers were required to register liscensed books. These where then able to be cencored by the British Government if the content was found controversial to the government. This was called the Licenseing Act of 1662, but was repealed by 1695. By 1710, Parliment established an act that would protect an authors works for up to fourteen years and were also renuable if the author was still alive by the experation date.For more information of the origins and in-depth time line <a href="https://www.arl.org/copyright-timeline/">Association of Research</a> is a good place to start.</p>
    
<li>Cue the United States</li> 
    
    <p>Different countries have varying laws on the usage and distribution of copywrite. The laws pertaining copywrite are outlines in chapters one though eight. Chapter two also explaines how original ownership can be transfered to another. This can be the whole ownership is transfered or just parts of it. Chapter eight covers royalties and judgments, stating that the judge must have a minumum of seven years expeience as a judge plus in-depth knowlege on copywite laws. <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/">Copywrite.gov</a> is a good place to start on more in-depth laws of copywritting in the UNited States.</p>
    
<li>How to File for Copywrite</li> 
    
    <p><a href="https://copyright-application-online.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw5fzrBRASEiwAD2OSVzRdbGrKdZm3MB4tHf61nd6YS7wMYoq3eJebtuGd4luoxTF8TTKrpxoC35IQAvD_BwE">Copywrite and Trademark Oline Registration</a> is one place to start when looking to file of copywrite or to file a claim. Like any other copywrite access, by applying you would have ownership rights. You'd also recieve an email with an electronic form to fill out. Once done you mail it back and can have those ownership rights within one day.</p>
    
<li>What is Copywrite?</li> 
    
    <p>Copywirte is the ownership of published and unpublished works ranging from literary works, to music to artwork. This isn't to be confused with a patent or material items. The basic copywrite laws we have today stem from the Constitution when authors wished for craters to have access and accesibility rights to their works. The three basic assesments to gain copywirte protections are originality, creativity, and fixation. Originality means that you were the person to create, write or compose a piece. Creativity means that there has to be a minimal amount of creativity that went into creating the piece. Fixation is the stability of the piece (i.e will it stand the weathers of time).

<li>Punishment for Infringment</li> 
    
    <p><a href="https://www.lib.purdue.edu/uco/CopyrightBasics/penalties.html">APurdue University</a> gives some insight to what would happen it copywrite infringment where to occer.</p> To better understand, infringment would be someone stealing anothers work, sometimes even claiming it as their own. To start prosecuting, the victum must have a valid copywrite license, the accused must have access to the sopywritted work, and the areas of accusation must be outside of the exscusable sections of a piece. Punishment ranges for paying for damages, paying a fine anywhere from $200 to $150,000, paying for all attorney fees and court costs, go to jail and other various punishments.
